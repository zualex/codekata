# DNA into RNA

## Purpose
DNA and RNA is the nucleotide sequence.  
The four nucleotides in DNA are adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G) and thymine (T).  
Four nucleotide in RNA is adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G) and uracil (U).  
RNA chain is made on the basis of the DNA chain sequence replacing each nucleotide:
- G -> C
- C -> G
- T -> A
- A -> U

Implement function `toRna` which takes as input and returns a DNA strand corresponding strand RNA.

## Example
```javascript
toRna('ACGTGGTCTTAA'); // 'UGCACCAGAAUU'
```

## Decision
